            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>- Hi, I'm CodeBucks, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, 
              and user-centered digital experiences. With 4 years of experience in the field. I am always looking for 
              new and innovative ways to bring my clients' visions to life. <br /> 
              I believe that design is about more than just making things look pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive, enjoyable experiences for users.

             Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and user-centered thinking to every project I work on. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to your next project. <br />
